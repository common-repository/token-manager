  <p class="tm_mainfont">
The Token Manager allows web developers to program PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript into tokens that can be used throughout WordPress. Tokens can be placed into themes, templates, pages, widgets, etc. The code in the token is processed and then injected into the token name. It allows web developers to package their code into components for easy reuse and maintenance while speeding up development time and distribution. The tokens are also aware of WordPress and can utilize all the common libraries and database from within the token. This allows for unlimited possibilities with web page design, third party api, WordPress api, PHP frameworks, web 2.0, other WordPress plugins, etc. The tokens can even be used within other tokens for replacement of text, making HTML, CSS, JS, fully dynamic.

  <h3>MultiSite</h3>
  <p class="tm_mainfont">
The Token Manager has been built to work with WordPress MultiSite as well as single blog installations. By activating it on the network, it will add the capabilities to control tokens across WordPress sites and blogs. It will also store all tokens in custom tables that are not attached to WordPress, allowing for easy upgrades, backup and version changes.
  </p>
  <h3>Token Management</h3>
  <p class="tm_mainfont">
The management of tokens is very simple, with built in ajax controls to allow assignment of tokens to individual and all pages. It also separates out frontpage assignment, giving you the freedom to control exactly what is seen on the frontpage. The manager also keeps track of who created and last updated the tokens in WordPress.
  </p>
  <h3>Token Parameters</h3>
  <p class="tm_mainfont">
The Token Manager now supports token parameters. You can specify a string or integer parameter by adding them behind the token name. You can then access the parameter from within the token code, allowing for unlimited code possibilities.
  </p>
  <h3>Error Handling</h3>
  <p class="tm_mainfont">
PHP and token errors are handled by the Token Manager and can be displayed by turning on custom settings in the manager. This gives developers the full control to know where errors are occurring within their token code. The error setting can also be turned off for live sites. This protects you from displaying error information on public sites. All errors that occur in the tokens, unless fatal, will not stop the webpage from being displayed. So feel free to code your ideas without worring about errors halting WordPress.
